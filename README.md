This repository contains implementations of various **Sliding Window Algorithm** problems using Python.
The  **Sliding Window** technique is a highly efficient approach to solving problems involving arrays and sequences, especially when optimizing time complexity over brute-force methods.
#  Implemented Problems
The notebook includes solutions for:
- **Fixed-size Sliding Window Problems**
- **Variable-size Sliding Window Problems**
- **Optimized Window Techniques**
