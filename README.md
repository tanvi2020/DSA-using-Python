Welcome to the DSA Daily Practice repository! This repository serves as a record of my daily practice and progress in mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It includes the concepts, techniques, and problems I‚Äôve tackled daily, as well as the algorithms I‚Äôve implemented from scratch.

## Introduction
This repository reflects my learning journey in DSA, focusing on both theoretical concepts and practical problem-solving. I tackle a new topic or algorithm every day, building my skills step by step. My goal is to become proficient in DSA, which is critical for acing coding interviews and solving real-world problems.
## Covered Topics
Here‚Äôs a list of the topics I have covered so far:
- Two Pointer Technique
- Sliding Window Problems
- Recursion
