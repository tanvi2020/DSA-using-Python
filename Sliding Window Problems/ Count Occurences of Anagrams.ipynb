    "Problem Statement discription : SO in this problem I will be given a string and a substring . And I will be asked to count the number of occurrences of the anagrams of that substring in the string . Also  before considering if the letters in a window are an anagram of the substring or not I will have to verify two things , First ---> the letters must be present in a continuous order and Second ---> The quantity of letters in substring and the window in the String must be the same \n",
    "\t1. So here K which is length of window is not specified . So k=length(substring)\n",
    "\t2. In this case I will be initiating four variables : i=0,j=0,dictionary={},ans=0,count=0\n",
    "\t3. Here i and j will be iterating over the String . Dictionary={} will store the key value pair of the distinct letters and their quantity in the substring . And count will keep a track of the count of each distinct letter in the dictionary . So if \n",
    "\tDictionary={a:2,b:1,c:1} and if the characters in the String match with those in Dictionary then count will decrease by one per character . So if Dictionary{a}=0 then count will be decremented by 1. Count will be 0 when all a ,b,and c inside the dictionary will be 0.#Store the distinct letters and their quantity inside the dictionary and\n",
